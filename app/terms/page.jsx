          The materials on Zeal are provided on an 'as is' basis. Zeal makes no
          warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all

        <h1>Terms and conditions</h1>
        <p>
          These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms
          and conditions of your use of the “Zeal” mobile application (“Mobile
          Application” or “Service”) and any of its related products and
          services (collectively, “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding
          between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Mobile Application
          developer (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into
          this Agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you
          represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this
          Agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer
          to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not
          agree with the terms of this Agreement, you must not accept this
          Agreement and may not access and use the Mobile Application and
          Services. By accessing and using the Mobile Application and Services,
          you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound
          by the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement is
          a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic
          and is not physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the
          Mobile Application and Services.

          responsible for maintaining the security of your account and you are
          fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and

          any kind may result in the termination of your account. You must
          immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any
          other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or

          result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete
          your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have
          violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or
          content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete
          your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for
          our Services. We may block your email address and Internet protocol
          address to prevent further registration.
